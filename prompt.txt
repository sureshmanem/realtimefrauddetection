Build an AI-powered real-time insurance fraud detection engine with the following requirements:

- Accept insurance claim submissions via a REST API (FastAPI).
- Preprocess and normalize claim data before analysis.
- Apply rule-based logic to flag claims (e.g., high amount, missing details).
- Use a machine learning model to assign a fraud score to each claim.
- Flag claims for review if either rules or ML model indicate suspicion.
- Log flagged claims for audit and investigation.
- Store all claims in a JSONL file for easy retrieval and analysis.
- Provide robust, parameterized testing using pytest and CSV data, with HTML reporting.
- Implement monitoring dashboards (CLI and web) to visualize claim volumes, flagged claims, and fraud rates over time.
- Organize the codebase into clear modules: API, preprocessing, rules, ML, decision, review, storage, monitoring, and testing.
- Support easy customization for new rules, model updates, and dashboard features.

Deliverables:
- Complete Python codebase with modular structure.
- Example test data and test suite.
- CLI and web dashboards for monitoring.
- Documentation (README.md) and setup instructions.
